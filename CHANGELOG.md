## [1.x.x] - Legacy Versions

### **Historical Note**
Previous versions (1.x.x) represented the fragmented application state with separate codebases:
- `fortigate-brand-system` - Branding and design components
- `fortigate-dashboard` - Main application dashboard
- `FortiGate-Network-Monitor-Pro` - Network monitoring features

These have been consolidated into the unified 2.0.0 platform architecture.
