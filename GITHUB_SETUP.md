cd C:\Users\south\FortiGate-Enterprise-Platform
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FortiGate-Enterprise-Platform.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

### **Option 2: Update Existing Repository**

If you already have a FortiGate repository on GitHub:

```bash
# Add existing repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_EXISTING_REPO_NAME.git

# Force push the new consolidated version (this will overwrite existing)
git push -u origin main --force

# WARNING: This will replace all existing content with the new consolidated platform
